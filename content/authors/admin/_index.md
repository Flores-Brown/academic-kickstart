Welcome to my website! (I apologize that it is still under construction.) I am currently an independent researcher of economics. I graduated in 2019 from Washington University in St. Louis with majors in economics and mathematics and a minor in history. My education included graduate-level work in economics, specializing in computational macroeconomics. My history minor concentrated in early Islamic history.

While I figure out my next steps, this site will serve as a publically available landing page for my various research and software projects.
